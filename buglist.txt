Known issues and todos in the Modelyze OCaml implementation
--------------------------------------------

2011-06-20: Declaring symbols and other let expressions does not seems
to have the same environment. Confusing for example when creating a
symbol using syntax "let x:floor" because floor exists in Base.mkl.

2011-10-29: Type problem of coerction when returning tuples of reals.

2011-10-29: There is a problem when calling curred built-in functions,
e.g., (+) 1 u, where u is a symbol. How do we pattern match on this?

Known issues and todos in the Modelyze libraries
---------------------------------
2011-08-05: There is an error in the hybrid ball stairs example. The
last stair case does not create a bounce.

2011-08-05: Panetelides implementation is not tested yet.

2011-08-05: Dummy-derivative is not implemented yet.

2011-08-05: Domain-specific branches is not implemented. Tested in
another git branch, but not included in the main trunk.

2011-08-05: y' cannot be used in probes (test in bouncing ball example).

2011-09-14: The order of how unknowns are declared matters for the end
result in test-hybrid-ball-stairs.mkl. If y is declared before x we
get a strange result.
