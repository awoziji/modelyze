Known issues in the MKL OCaml implementation
--------------------------------------------

2011-06-20: Declaring symbols and other let expressions does not seems
to have the same environment. Confusing for example when creating a
symbol using syntax "let x:floor" because floor exists in Base.mkl

2011-08-05: A local let construct overwrites varaibles that should
be closed by another definition, e.g. function
  let main = dpa (dpb (
    let x = 1 in
    let f x:Int -> Int =  x
    in
      f 2 ))
results in value 1 but it should be 2. The term that is to be translated
in eval.ml is
  let main  = let @fresh0  = 1 in let f x:Int = @fresh0 in (f 2) in ()
hence, it seems like the pattern generation function in pattarn.ml creates
fresh variables in a wrong way. The first question is why a "match" was
generated in the first place.
