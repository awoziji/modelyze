Modelyze toolchain, version 1.11
-----------------------------------------------------
This project contains a simple interpreter for the 
Modelyze language. For a detailed overview of the
Modelyze language, please see the technical report:

David Broman and Jeremy G. Siek. "Modelyze: a Gradually Typed Host Language 
for Embedding Equation-Based Modeling Languages", Technical Report No. 
UCB/EECS-2012-173, University of California, Berkeley, June 30, 2012.
Available at: http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2012/EECS-2012-173.html

A comprehensive description of Modelyze's predecessor, called MKL, is available
in David Broman's PhD Thesis:

INSTALLATION (Mac OS)
--------------------
To run the Modelyze interpreter on an UNIX-based system, 
do the following steps:

1. Install the SUNDIALS solver suite version 2.4.0 or later. 
   http://computation.llnl.gov/casc/sundials/
2. Install Macports (including X11 support)
   http://www.macports.org/
3. Install Objective Caml compiler, ocamlfind, and gnuplot via Macports
   >> sudo port install ocaml caml-findlib gnuplot
4. Unzip the Modelyze source code and compile the project using command
   >> build byte

INSTALLATION (Ubuntu 10.11)
---------------------------
1. Install OCaml, GnuPlot and SUNDIALS. Execute the following in the terminal
   >>sudo apt-get install ocaml ocaml-findlib gnuplot libsundials-serial
2. Unzip the Modelyze source code and compile the project using command
   >> build byte
 
 


EXAMPLES
--------
Under folder "library", a simple standard library for Modelyze is provided.
The files named "test-*" are testfiles programs. To execute a program, 
run for instance:

./modelize test-lotkavolterra.moz

This prints the plot data to the standard output. If GnuPlot is installed,
plotting can be done as follows:

./pmodelize test-hybrid-ball-stairs.moz

REVISIONS
---------

Version 1.11 September 24, 2013
  - Minor bugfixes and cleanup.

Version 1.1 December 17, 2012.
  - Changed the name of the project from "MKL" to "Modelyze". The rationale
    for the change is to emphasize that Modelyze is a host language for
    embedding DSLs.
  - Full gradual typing is now implemented according to the technical report
    http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2012/EECS-2012-173.html. The
    type system and the symbol lifting analysis correspond to the description.
    Cast insertion has not been implemented.  
  - Pattern matching on symbols do not need to have the ~ anymore. Instead, the
    compiler recognized if the pattern variable equal to a globally defined 
    symbol and in such a case it is treated as a symbol matching instead of
    a pattern variable 
  - Simplified the way of creating symbolic data types. Now these are always
    symbolic types. Defintions of equations and nodes are now simpler.
  - Add def-syntax, which is closer to Java or C. { } are used as
    grouping of expressions, not as defining arrays.
  - Added new syntax for derivatives, e.g., der(x) can be written x' and
    der(der(y)) can be written y''
  - Changed the syntax for polymorphic equality from == to <==>. Added 
    operators == and ==. meaning real and integer equality test respectively.
    The rationale is that == can now be used as part of a model.
  - Added two new keywords "begin" and "end", which have the same 
    functionality as parentheses.
  - Renamed initialization keyword from "Init" to "init". Also, the 
    init operator "<-" can be used instead of "init".
  - Renamed the "when" guard on patterns to use keyword "if". In this
    way, "when" can be used in the DSLs.
  - It is now possible to plot a probe that does not exist during the
    whole simulation, e.g., a probe that exists in a specific state.
  - A function can be called either by using space between paranthesis, e.g.
      foo p1 p2
    or to use paranthesis and a comma separated list (as in C or Java)
      foo(p1,p2)
    For the latter, it is important that it there are no white space
    between foo and the left paranhesis. In this case, this is
    translated into a curried call. If foo was supposed to take a tuple
    as argument, it can be called as follows (note the space)
      foo (p1,p2)

Version 1.0.0 - October 1, 2010
  - First version corresponding to David Broman's PhD Thesis.
  - Changed operators for Real and Int, so that e.g., -. and +. are
    for integer operations instead of Real. The rationale is that most
    expressions are written using Reals.
